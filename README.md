# Whiskquilibrium

A 2D platformer game devised and developed during the [Megathon Hackathon at IIIT Hyderabad](https://megathon.in/).
It involves a cat named "Minto" trapped in a quantum world. She has the ability to shift her state between being alive and a ghostly dead form. Her prescence itself changes the nature of the world around her. Can you solve the obstacles in her path that prevent her from escaping the mad world she is in?

The game was developed using the Godot engine and GDScript.
You can find more information about the project on [this blog](https://testsubjector.github.io/blog/2018/10/16/Whiskquilibrium-The-Game).

~~Goal - To be developed enough to be released on Steam~~
Currently, there are no future plans to develop this game.
